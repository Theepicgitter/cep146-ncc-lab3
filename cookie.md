## Quick Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Mix dry ingredients** in a bowl (measure flour correctly by scooping and leveling)
2. **Cream butter and sugars** together (butter should be softened)
3. **Add eggs and vanilla**, beat to combine
4. **Stir in dry ingredients** until just combined
5. **Add chocolate chips** and mix until evenly distributed
6. **Roll dough into balls** using a cookie scoop for uniform size
7. **Bake at 380°F for 8-10 minutes** - don't overbake! They should look slightly underdone
8. **Cool on baking sheet** for 5 minutes before transferring to wire rack

**Key tip:** Remove cookies when they still look a bit doughy - they'll finish setting as they cool.
